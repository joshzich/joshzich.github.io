  As far as Gregorc Thinking Style goes, I tend towards Concrete Random. This means that I like experimenting to find answers, but I often am impulsive and trust my intuition. I like to burrow into a problem and experience it head on. That's how I learn best. 
  </p>
  <p>Here are some problems with this approach:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>It's easy to get lost in nuances of a problem, and spend too much time tinkering around with them.</li>
  <li>It can also be easy to skip over crucial steps that only become obvious later.</li>
  <li>A haphazard/experimental approach to a website can become problematic to organization and therefore time-consuming later.</li>
  </ul>

  This has played out so far in my experienc of Phase 0 at DBC. I have been able to cope with my thinking style and utilize it for good, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get a BA. But, I still have some negative tendencies that I am always struggling with. My website isn't as uniform as I'd like it to be. Some of my styling happened in HTML and some of it happened in my two CSS style sheets. This is because I was always tinkering around to get things right, and instead of going back to make changes to what I had done before, I ended up just adding new styling to HTML and CSS.

  I figure that part of having a mindset centered around growth would mean learning to accept my natural tendencies while making some changes to adapt. In this case, that would mean realizing that I have a lot of things the way I want them as far as layout is concerned. But also then going back again and transferring all of that formatting to my CSS files in a uniform fashion. Doing this will allow me to save time, and give me more flexibility later, even though it goes against my natural instinct. If I start these habits now, it will eventually come naturally to me, and then I will have grown into a more well rounded individual that can learn through experimentation, but also take advantage of smart procedures that will save time in the long run.
