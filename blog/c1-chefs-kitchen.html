      Shereef's metaphore of Kitchen vs. Restaurant culture really resonates with me. I'm happy to hear that DBC is more oriented towards the Kitchen side, that is, they encourage you to participate in your own educational experience and to take ownership of it. The Restaurant culture, in this metaphore, says that you are a consumer of a package deal. You paid for a service, and you get that service. This attitude seems to take for granted what education is really all about. It's when you really engage and discover on your own that real learning takes place.

        My hope is that I can live up to the Kitchen culture professed in by Shereef in his video. I, like everyone probably, has a tendency to want their education handed to them as easily as a meal is in a Restaurant. But that attitude isn't good for me, and it certainly will not contrubute to a healthy learning environment for my cohorts. I  hope that I can contribute to creating an environment where my cohorts are learning from me just as much as I know I will be learning from them.

      I'm definitely digging the vibe I'm getting that DBC is going for a more holistic approach to education. In order to have a healthy mind, you've got to care of the body as well. Things like yoga, and the emotionally supportive environment at DBC should lead to amazing results in the creative and productive realms that our intellects will be delving into. I'm excited to see what this approach to eductation will yield.
