     If you are new to coding like myself, you may have heard of a little thing called “git”. Git is a popular program that people use for something called “Version Control”. Version Control means that while you are writing code, a program like git is constantly tracking the little changes you are making to your code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine that when you are writing a piece of code you are actually playing a really hard video game. The goal is to make the code work and do what you want it to do. But you can’t save the game (which makes the process of winning a lot easier and a lot less time consuming) without a program called git. Once you have git, all you need to do is to make a repository, or the place where you would like git to keep track of. Then you add changes to git via the command line on the Terminal. Just type “git add < name of file >” to add the new file to a queue to be saved to the repository. Or simply type “git add .” to add all of the changes you’ve made to the queue. Then save all of the changes with a message reminding you what the point of the changes were to refer to later by typing ‘git commit –m “< the message you want to type>"’.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another reason that git is essential is it makes experimenting with your code A LOT easier.  Once you are in a git repository in your Terminal, you will notice that at the end of the line there is a conspicuous new title in brackets called “[master]”. This is the title of the branch you are currently on in git. You can change branches by typing “git checkout < name of new branch >”. You can do anything you want to on this new branch and your master branch will remain intact. Then, if you make changes that you want to keep, simply type “git checkout master” and then merge the changes with “git merge newbranch/master”.
    </p>

    If you have heard about git, you probably have also heard of (and confused it with) GitHub. They are not the same thing, but they are related. GitHub is where the code that you track with git can live online. This is ideal for programmers because it is a perfect way to share and collaborate with all of the advantages that git brings to the equation. Review the code of your peers and vice versa. Work on different parts of the same code and merge them all together. Monitor all of your teams changes. Fetch them from GitHub, and merge them with your local repository. Then, make changes and push them to GitHub for your peers to see. Git and GitHub are essential tools for programmers today. So get git and get GitHub. Get it?
