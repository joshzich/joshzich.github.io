    The major issue that the world of technology has to deal with today is the unbelivable distraction that it can be in our day-to-day lives. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Concentrating on tasks, especially those that have to be done through computers, are becoming harder and harder. Even now, I'm fighting the urge to go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEhaVhta7sI">youtube</a> and watch funny cat videos. 
  </p>
  <p>
    How can a person be expected to write an essay on the same device that they watch their favorite tv show, or play their favorite game? Or, how can a person be expected to pay attention to the road, when they are making plans on their phone via text messages?
  </p>
  <p>In these cases, technology not only becomes a hazard
  to getting work done, it also becomes a life-threatening
  distraction, all while supplying the most powerful tools
  for research, organization, and work.  
  </p>

  <p> 
    So, how does one cope? Should we abandon the net, become ludites, use a payphone, and pretend to be
    living in a bygone era? 
  </p>
  <p>
    I would say no. One has to adapt to the new contexts in which we find ourselves doing work, commuting, and living our lives, or technology itself will need to insert itself into our lives in different ways.  
  </p>
    <p>
    We are already starting to see this happen. 
    There are apps to block prevent texting while driving, voice texting, etc. As far as working on a computer goes, as far as I know, this requires self discipline and self awareness. It would be wonderful if you could set your computer and your phone to "work mode" so that it could anticipate what your needs will be, preventing distracting sites/advertisements/games from being used... or atleast making them harder to use.  
    </p>

    <p>
      But until that happens, we will struggle to get work done, and all the while resisting the urge to click a couple of buttons and experience hilarious cat videos!
      Well that's my two cents on the problems of technology today. Thanks for reading!
