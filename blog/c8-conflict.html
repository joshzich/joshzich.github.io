    We all wish that we could coast through life without any arguments. Unfortunately for most people, this isn't the way life works. Tensions of all kinds are lurking beneath the surface, and sometimes they are unearthed and then our feelings, our pride, and -- in a work environment -- our productivity, are all on the line. In my work experience, I've had to deal with several conflicts, one of which is a good example of how a conflict was mediated and damage to our productivity minimized.    

  </p>
  <p>
    When I was in college, I took a film production class where the whole class was divided into groups of four that would work together for the rest of the semester. Each group had four short film projects. Luckily, my group agreed at the beginning of the semester that each person would be a director of a their own project throughout the semester, and that the director always would have final say over what was done in that project. This way, we all got a fair shot to exercise our creative desires and we also would save time if there were creative differences that needed to be resolved. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Although this was a good plan, disagreements still arose immediately. There was a strong disagreement with the way a certain shot should be lit. The specifics of the lighting are not really relevant to this blog. The important details had to do with the dynamic of the argument and how it was resolved. We were at a location, we only had so many hours to devote to this project. Our director was hesitant to make a concrete decision. There was one member of our team who thought that the scene should be lit a certain way, and rest of us disagreed.
  </p>

  <p>
  	 I felt, not really angry per say, but a very strong feeling that this person was jeopardizing the project by insisting on their way instead of leaving it to the director like we had agreed. I knew from talking with the director what they actually wanted to do, but they wouldn't take control and make a decision. I’m not going to lie, things were getting intense!
  </p>

  <p>
  	 We spent a good deal of time arguing about it, and no one budged. It looked like no matter what, productivity, feelings, and pride were going to be hurt. I — though, I believed we were right — suggested that we shoot the shot with both the lighting the three of us wanted and the lighting that the lone member felt so strongly was correct. That way we would be able to decide later in post and we wouldn’t have to waste time arguing about it anymore that day. This turned out to save the dynamic of our team. 
  </p>

  <p>
  	So, the decision to shoot the shot with both our preferred lighting and the dissenting member’s preferred lighting turned out to be a great idea. It made the dissenter feel their idea was respected. It gave us real options just incase we turned out to be wrong, and it saved us the time of arguing out our points on the spot. I believe that respecting the dissenting voice was essential to the resolution of the conflict. If that hadn’t happened, all of our future projects could have suffered. If I could go back and relive those moments, I would suggest immediately filming both versions of the scene instead of wasting any time or energy arguing about it. 
  </p>

  <p>
  	I learned how to deal with this type of conflict in a working environment. There were a myriad of factors that lead to our disagreement. We all cared about the project, but we had differing perspectives. The important thing was resolving the conflict in a way where we all felt respected and that preserved the quality of our project.
  </p>

  <p>
  	Those are my thoughts about conflicts. Unfotunatlly we all have them. And we have to deal with them. Hopefully we can deal with them in a way that preserves our human decency, and our mutual respect.
