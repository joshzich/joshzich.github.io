    To pair or not to pair... that is the question! What about pears the fruit? They are good. 
    ALSO: high in vitamin C. Shall we pair human together with human to work? We already pair our shoes, pair our pants (even though it's only one thing), and pair our glasses... We even, dare I say, pair our pears!

  <p>
    But... pair programming? What is the point? Well, as you will find out from my blog... there is indeed a purpose even for that. AND, I would say, especially now that I have had the joy of experiencing it first hand, that pairing people is preferred! So far, at DBC, pair programming has been an integral part of our education.

    So far, I have loved working with other people. I think I've benefitted a lot from them, and (I hope) they have benefitted from working with me. It has been really fun and interesting finding people to pair with. I didn't really intend to do it, but I ended up pairing with someone completely new every time, with only two exceptions. The sessions were great. I feel as though the experiences have enriched my perspective on coding and problem solving in general.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Some pairing sessions have been easier than others. I think it all boils down to communication and being upfront and straight forward, while still being open to ideas and flexible. 
    The best moments have been when I could contribute something, when me and my partner figure out things together at the same time, and the many times my partners have taught me new things. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I was really encouraged by all the feedback I read today from my pairing sessions. It made me realize that I have actually grown more than I had percieved. Many people seemed to believe that I had a good grasp on the material, which was sort of flattering and a bit of a pleasant surprise. The biggest pattern I saw in the feedback I recieved was to be more confident and forthcoming in my ideas. And also not to minimize the contributions I make. I will try to improve on these things the next time I have a pairing session.   
  </p>
  <p>
    Writing feedback for others was a challenge, but I hope that I was able to both encourage and shed light on any areas that could use improvement. Usually the areas that needed improvement were almost always mutual, so I felt at times like a bit of a hypocrite when giving constructive criticism. One big thing I learned from reading others feedback was how helpful it can be. I am amazed at how well others have done in sumarizing the experience and giving positive and constructive feedback to me.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, I think the system of feedback at DBC is very helpful and informative. I was inspired by reading what others had to say about working with me, and I hope that I can provide them the service of such insightful feedback as they provided to me.
