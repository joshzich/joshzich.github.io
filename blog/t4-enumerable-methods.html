  <p>Have you ever wanted to group elements of data before into sub-groups in Ruby but didn't know how?</p>
  <p>I am new to programming, and I just discovered an enumberable method that can be used for just that.</p>
  <p>
    The method <code>group_by</code> is a way of getting elements from an array into a hash by organizing them under arrays whose keys are the results returned by the block. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if we wanted to organize a list of movies aphabetically
    <code> movies = ["Star Wars", "Jaws", "Harry Potter", "Alphaville", "Alien", "Django Unchained", "Dancer in the Dark", "Tron"] </code>
     but wanted to pull them up in groups like 'A-F','G-L','M-S','T-Z'.  we would type:  
  </p>

  <p>
    Say you wanted to catagorize numbers by how many times 5 can go into them.  <code> numbers = (1..20).to_a.group_by {|num| num/5}</code>

  </p>
  <p>You get the resulting hash:</p>
