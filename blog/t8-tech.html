    Web applications often require a lot of data that is constantly in flux. When dealing with a lot of data, it helps to be able to keep track of that data in an organized way. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Active record is a pattern for facilitating something called Object Relational Mapping, and was originally defined by Martin Fowler in his book Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. This means that accessing and storing data about objects in databases is made possible without actually having to go to the trouble of writing SQL queries. 
  </p>


  <p>
    In Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord is a library that provides a common base for models, and is used to implement the active record pattern. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if you cause a class to inherit from the class Base in the ActiveRecord library, you gain access to methods that allow you to create and pull data from a database without writing any SQL. Methods in ActiveRecordâ€™s classes allow one to easily turn class attributes into columns in SQL and new objects into rows. 
  </p>

  <code> class User < ActiveRecord::Base </code>

  <p>
    To create the table in the database, it is necessary to create a schema class that inherits the tools from a class in ActiveRecord called Migration. This may be confusing, remember that once you create a class that inherits from Base, you gain methods to read and write new rows and columns in a data base, and that is not the same as actually making a new table.
  </p>

  <code>class UserTable < ActiveRecord::Migration</code>

  <p>
    Again, this is all done through writing easy-to-read Ruby, making the life of the programmer a lot easier. 
  </p>

  <p>
    One fundamental part of AR is that it stores the relationship between models. These relationships are called 'associations'. As part of the Base class, you can impart on objects the relationships that they have with other objects. These relationships will remind you of one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relatiohsips in your typical relational data-base. Not only does active record store these relationships in a data-base like you would expect, it also adds methods to the objects themselves that allow you to call on these relationships. If there were no associations between models, the objects themselves wwould be unable to tell us who they belong to. For instance, if you have a Car class and a Person class, you might want each Car to only have one owner. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Create the Car class with the Base instance method <code> has_one </code> and then followed by the name of the class <code> Person</code>. 
  </p>

  <pre>
  class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :person 
  end
  </pre>

  <p>
    And you would do likewise for the creation of the Person class accept with the <code> has_many </code> method.  
  </p>

  <pre>
  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :cars
  </pre>


  <p>
    The varying names of the models have to do more with their table names than with their class names. Because Rails will automatically 
    pluralize the name of a class to make a table for that class, Rails knows what you are talking about when you pluralize the name with the corresponding has_many method. 
  </p>


  <p>
    The last thing I will talk about when it comes to AR is Validations. Validations are again part of the Base class. You will use them in order to set conditions for the creation of your objects in the database. For instance:
  </p>

  <pre>
  class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates :type, presence: true
  end
  </pre>

  <p>
    This will prevent a car from being added to the database that doesn't have a type defined. You can see how this will prevent your database from being poluted with unusable data. You get to set the conditions for the creation of new data to your database. 
  </p>

  <p>
    There is much more to discuss on each of these topics. But I hope that this gives you a brief overview of ActiveRecord.
