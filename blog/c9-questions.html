    One of the big things you learn when trying to do anything that involves programming is that you will most likley be asking a lot of questions online. Of course, if you have common question that has already been answered, you can just ask google by typing into the search box. If that doesn't answer your question, you may need to go to somwhere like stack overflow. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When you are putting a question out online to be answered by ready and able programmers try to remember a few things: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make your title like you would want it to be if you were searching for the problem in google.</li>
      <p>In other words, be specific enough that people can identify the exact problem you are looking for, but brief and concise enough so that the title isn't confusing or a hassle to read.</p>
    <li>Describe your problem in more detail in the introduction.</li>
      <p>For those answering your questions, it will help to know the context of your problem. What were you trying to do with the code? What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Be sure to mention all relevant information pertaining to your problem.</p>
    <li>Rebuild the code to be presented as an example</li>
      <p>You will want to alter the code you present for several reasons. One is that you don't want to share any information that could be confidential to an employer or yourself. Two, you will want to get rid of all unnecessary code that could throw off, annoy, or confuse people trying to solve the problem. Three, in this process you might solve the problem.</p>
    <li>Include relevant code, even if it isn't in the same file.</li>
      <p>Be sure to add any relevant code that is relevant to the problem. You might need to show code that is connected with a problem in HTML even if that code is in CSS or JavaScript.</p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Bottomline, try to be considerate of the future beneficiaries of your question, and the programmers who are answering your question. In doing this, you might actually solve the problem. Also, don't ask questions right off the bat. Try to solve it yourself and also try to search for the problem to see if it has already been answered. If your problem seems to be unique, it should be fair game for stack overflow.
