    I recently watched a really good lecture by a professor at Columbia named Claude M. Steele. The video is entitled "Identity and Stereotype Threat". Steele points out how subtle cues can negatively effect the outcome of performance when those cues point toward negative stereotypes about groups with which the participant identifies. He points to studies that show how these stereotypes can be utilized in such a way as to help performance in certain ways as well.

    When thinking upon my own life, the first thing that comes to mind, though it is of little significance, is the stereotype some people have about glasses. People used to make fun of me calling me "four-eyes", and "Harry Potter", etc. Other than ridicule, some other assumptions may have been assimilated. Since I have glasses, I'm bad at sports. Or, since I have glasses, I do well in school. I think that I came to believe these things in a way. I feel smarter with my glasses on, which is insane.

  	Since that is crazy... maybe I should try out for basketball! Hey, anyone want to play?

  	In all seriousness, this is a pretty pathetic version of stereotype threat because I can easily take my glasses off, or use contact lenses. But I think it still counts, even if just a small amount. It's the best way for me to empathize with people who face the real challenge presented by a society that imposes these stereotypes on groups negatively.

  	For me, <i>stereotype threat</i> is another way of saying, "being psyched out and not believing in your own potential". In a sense, it is comparable to the fixed and growth mindsets that we talked about earlier. If you are a victim of stereotype threat, you have been tricked into a false/fixed idea about yourself that you feel you have to hide. Therefore, to achieve, you have to trick people into believing that you are more than what you yourself believe you are, which will hurt you in the long run. If you can believe in your own potential, then you will be able to avoid being tricked into believing you are limited by something like a negative stereotype of a group you identify with, or a static idea about yourself that you have come to believe.  
  </p>
  <p>
  	What makes this unfair, is that it is an extra effort for people to conciously overcome stereotype threat. Those who are not effected or who benefit from stereotypes should consider ways of correcting this by minimizing cues that negatively effect people and maximizing cues that positively effect everyone.
