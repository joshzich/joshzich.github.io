    Affirmation, as we learned from Claude M. Steel's presentation, is key in overcoming some of the psychological threats presented by stereotypes. As part of this blog, I am examining values that are most important to me and rating from 1 - 5 in how I actually try to live up to each value. 
  </p>
  <p>
  I chose:
  </p>
  <p>
    Accomplishment: 4
  </p>
  <p>
    Growth: 4
  </p>
  <p>
    Friendships: 4
  </p>
  <p>
    Meaningful Work: 4
  </p>
  <p>
    Excitement: 4
  </p>
  <p>
    Transcendence: 4
  </p>

  <p>
    
  </p>

  <p>
    I can't say that I actually try to achieve one over the other. Sometimes though, unfortunately, they appear to contradict in my life. Time with friends/excitement vs accomplishment/meaningful work vs transcendence/growth. Trying to nurture these things takes time.
  </p>

  <p>
    For me, trancendence is when you experience something (whether it be in relationships, meditation, work, art, etc.) that gives you a perspective that is beyond day-to-day life. And that experience gives you new insight into life in general. For me, trancendence is unpredictable. But for me it tends to depend on all of the other values I chose, plus some others that are probably missing from this list.     
  </p>

  <p>
    So, DBC is asking me what the last time was that someone asked me for advice, and if it had something to do with the values I selected for this blog... I think it was my opinion on something that had to do with a creative project that my friend was working on. We share aesthetic tastes, and that's probably a part of why we are friends. So it definitley relates to our common values, what excites us, and what we find appealing. 
  </p>

  <p>
    As far as self affirmation is concerned, I think remembering to keep a balance between your values is key. Make sure that all of these values can be nurtured in a way that makes sense. If I feel myself giving in to something like stereotype threat, I think remembering my values and how they connect will definitely help. 
  </p>

  <p>
    A lot of our own ability is limited by psychology. All we can do as a community is try to understand that human beings are not two dimentional characters. How we treat people, and the expectations that we have on eachother can and does make a big difference. But, that doesn't mean that people cannot overcome ignorant attitudes. No one should feel powerless in the face of a stereotype that they feel defines what they can and can't do in life. That being said, it is unfair to expect individuals to overcome stereotype threat all on their own. Everyone should do their part to remind one another that we are not limited by any stereotype of any group to which we may belong.
