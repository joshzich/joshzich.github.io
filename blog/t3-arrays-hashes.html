  <p>Hashes and Arrays make life easier in programming because they allow you to store things away and to retrieve them when needed.</p>

  <p>The fundamental difference debtween arrays and hashes has to do with how you retrieve what you need from them.</p>

  <p>An array contains objects which you can retrieve via index starting at 0 and going for as long as the list is. So if you had an array like this: <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> and you called 0 on the array like this: <code>array[0]</code>, then you would get the first number in the array, 1. If you called <code>array[2]</code>, you would get 3 and so on.</p> 

  <p>Instead of an index, a Hash has what are called 'key value pairs'. A hash could look like this: <code>{'NC'=>'North Carolina', 'SC'=>'South Carolina', 'TN'=>'Tennessee'}</code>. In order to access North Carolina, you would have to call it with its key NC: <code>hash['NC']</code>.</p>

  <p>The objects in a hash have no order since they only correspond with their individual keys.</p>

  <p>The order of an array does matter however, and there are sever methods that can take advantage of the order of and change the order of arrays.</p>

  <p>Broadly speaking, arrays come in handy when organization easily applicable to the data and needed for the situation in which you want to use the data. While hashes are more useful for situastions in which little organization is needed and less easily imposed on the data. </p>
